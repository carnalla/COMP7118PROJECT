# COMP7118PROJECT

This GitHub repository contains Python program files associated with the Spring 2022 Course Project for COMP7118 at the University of Memphis by Alexander M. Carnall.

The repository contains three files of executable and annotated code for three main parts of the project including: 

1. 'Data Acquisition.ipynb': This executable is annotated and will run to produce a corpus of injury data from www.prosportstransactions.com. The code then cleans the resulting dataframe of erroneous/irrelevant data and acquires predictor variables for both an injured and control group of equal sizes for use in the project. 


2. 'Feature Selection.ipynb': This executable is annotated and will run three algorithms for feature selection from files generated in executable one above. 


3. 'Machine Learning.ipynb': This executable runs the experiments outlined in the project file, and generates outputs for use in results/analysis and discussion of project objectives.
